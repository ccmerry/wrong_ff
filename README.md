# wrong_ff
Fantasy football that is intentionally incorrect (to send to your league mates of course)


-used nflfastR to import data -players have their weekly yardage stats increased or decreased by a random amount (averages 3%) 

-random changes are seed so the value stays the same everytime you check the values
